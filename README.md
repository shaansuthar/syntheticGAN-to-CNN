# Impact of Synthetic Data on performance of Image Classifiers

This project uses GANs to generate synthetic image data and evaluates its impact on CNN image classification. By comparing a CNN trained on real data alone to one trained with both real and GAN-generated data, it assesses the effectiveness of GAN-based augmentation using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
